def __init__(self, val=0, next=None): --> This defines what data each node will have when it is created.

This is a constructor __ it runs when a node is created.
__init__ tells Python what properties each object (node) should have.
self	Refers to the current object
val=0	Default value of node
next=None	By default, node points to nothing
Next This node stores the address of the next node.
        node1 = ListNode(1)
        node2 = ListNode(2)
        node1.next = node2



self in detail 
#------
self means this object.
It helps store data inside that node.
Without self, Python wouldn’t know which node’s data to change.

class ListNode:

linked list node needs to store:
Value (data)
Address of next node
So we create a blueprint (class) to represent one node.
👉 Think of it like a box that stores data + pointer.

class define:

A class is a blueprint used to create objects that group data + behavior together.
Instead of separate variables, we bundle everything into one object.
