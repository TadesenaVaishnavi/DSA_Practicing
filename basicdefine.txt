def __init__(self, val=0, next=None): --> This defines what data each node will have when it is created.

This is a constructor __ it runs when a node is created.
__init__ tells Python what properties each object (node) should have.
self	Refers to the current object
val=0	Default value of node
next=None	By default, node points to nothing
Next This node stores the address of the next node.
        node1 = ListNode(1)
        node2 = ListNode(2)
        node1.next = node2



self in detail 
#------
self means this object.
It helps store data inside that node.
Without self, Python wouldn’t know which node’s data to change.

class ListNode:

linked list node needs to store:
Value (data)
Address of next node
So we create a blueprint (class) to represent one node.
👉 Think of it like a box that stores data + pointer.

class define:

A class is a blueprint used to create objects that group data + behavior together.
Instead of separate variables, we bundle everything into one object.



STACK
------
A **stack** is a **linear data structure** that follows the **LIFO principle** — **Last In, First Out**.

👉 The last element added is the first one removed.
👉 Example: **stack of plates** — you remove the top plate first.

**Basic operations:**
* **Push** – add an element
* **Pop** – remove the top element
* **Peek/Top** – view the top element

(**) Auxiliary Stack
an extra (supporting) stack used along with the main stack to help solve a problem efficiently. --- stack inside another stack


## **Linear means elements are arranged one after the other in a single sequence (not branching).
Examples of linear data structures:

Array
Stack
Queue
Linked List


(**)Monotonic Decreasing Stack
A monotonic decreasing stack is a stack where elements are stored in decreasing order from bottom to top.

Why used?
To find Next Greater Element
To solve problems efficiently in O(n) time
