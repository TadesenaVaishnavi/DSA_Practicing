# 1) float('-inf')

int() cannot represent negative infinity, so int("-inf") is invalid and throws an error.
#****
float("-inf") is a valid special floating-point value representing negative infinity.

Using float("-inf") ensures any real number in the list will be larger and update correctly.

# 2) sort is a list method, and max is a built-in Python function.
### **Function**

# * A function is **independent** and can be called directly (e.g., `max(nums)`).
# * It is *not tied* to any specific object.

# ### **Method**

# * A method is a **function that belongs to an object** (e.g., `nums.sort()`).
# * It is called **using the object**, because it works *on* that object.


# ****
# **Shortcut memory:**
# 👉 **Function = free**
# 👉 **Method = attached to an object**

# trick to remember function - free f f
# sort is a list method, and max is a built-in Python function.
