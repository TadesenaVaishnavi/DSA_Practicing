# DT
# if __name__ == "__main__":--- WHY
# ---When Python runs any script, it needs to keep track of how that script is being
# used:
# Is this script being run directly by you?

# Or is it being imported as a module into another script?




# Python sets __name__ = "__main__" in this file.

# So, the code inside the if __name__ == "__main__": block runs.

# This is where you put things like:

# Running tests

# Calling functions

# Printing output

# Basically, this code runs only when you want the script to do something directly.
