return
When return executes, the function immediately stops.

break, continue, pass → interview favorites
break
break terminates the loop completely when a condition is met.
continue
Skip the current iteration and move to the next one.
  x == 3 --> 1245
pass
pass does nothing and is used as a placeholder to avoid syntax errors.

  
1️⃣ Data Types (VERY IMPORTANT)
int, float, complex
string
list
tuple
set
dictionary
boolean
📌 Key things to remember:
List → mutable
Tuple → immutable
Set → unordered, unique values
Dict → key-value pairs

: Why are tuples faster than lists?
A: Because tuples are immutable and have less memory overhead.


FUNCTION:
A **function** is a **reusable block of code** that performs a **specific task** and runs **only when it is called**.

Parameter
A **parameter** is a **variable defined in a function definition** that receives a value when the function is called.

def add(a, b):   # a and b are parameters
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)   # 5 and 3 are arguments
print(result)

*Default arguments
**Default arguments** are function parameters that **take a predefined value if no argument is passed during the function call**.
def greet(name, message="Good Morning"):  # message is default argument
    print(message, name)

greet("Vaishnavi")              # uses default value
greet("Vaishnavi", "Hello")     # overrides default value

range(start, stop, step)

range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1)
len(s) does NOT include 0,1,2,3
👉 It just gives total count (4) and len starts from 1,2,3,4
start ---> len(s) -1 👉 So len(s) - 1 means:
          Start from the last index (3)    
          This has NOTHING to do with reverse.
          It is just because indexing starts from 0.
stop ---> -1 It is used so that 0 gets included.
step --> The third value -1 means:
        👉 Move backward
        👉 Decrease by 1 each time

👉 -1 means last element
👉 -2 means second last

convertion
-----------
A base tells how many digits a number system uses.
| Number System | Base | Digits Used |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Decimal       | 10   | 0–9         |
| Binary        | 2    | 0–1         |
| Octal         | 8    | 0–7         |
| Hexadecimal   | 16   | 0–9, A–F    |


Binary  
-------
Computers use binary because internally they work with:

0 = OFF
1 = ON
