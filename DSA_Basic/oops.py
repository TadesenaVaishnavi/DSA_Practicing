OOPS is a programming approach where we organize code using classes and objects to make it structured and reusable.

OOP improves modularity, reusability, and scalability in ML applications.

We use OOPS to:
✅ Organize code properly
✅ Reuse code (using inheritance)
✅ Reduce duplication
✅ Make applications scalable
✅ Improve security (data hiding)

Encapsulation → Hide data inside a class
Abstraction → Show only necessary details
Inheritance → One class uses properties of another
Polymorphism → Same method, different behavior

The main principles are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

OOPS helps in organizing ML pipelines, separating data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation into reusable classes.

class define:
A class is a blueprint used to create objects that group data + behavior together.
Instead of separate variables, we bundle everything into one object.

Encapsulation
--------------
Encapsulation means combining data and the functions that work on that data into a single unit--- fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) concept
Example:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
Inheritance
------------
One class acquires properties of another.
like parent to child 

Polymorphism
------------
Same function name → different behavior.
like bat, park

Abstraction
------------
Hide implementation details.
